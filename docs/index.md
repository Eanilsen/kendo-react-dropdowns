# DropDowns Overview (draft)

DropDowns allow you to choose a value from a predefined list of options. The DropDowns package includes the Kendo UI AutoComplete, ComboBox, and DropDownList components for React.

The AutoComplete provides suggestions to the user from a previously entered list of options depending on the typed input.

The ComboBox displays a list of predefined options. It allows the user to pick a single value from that list, or to enter a custom value through keyboard input.  

The DropDownList displays a list of predefined options and allows the user to pick a single value from that list.
